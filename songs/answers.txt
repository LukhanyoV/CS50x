Question 1:
Q: If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
A: I would categorize their audio aura as "Purple" as the average danceability of the songs is high.

Question 2:
Q: Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
A: Well The listener might not be in the same mood as they were when they started to like the songs,
so they might just be listening to the songs out of habit or because they liked the songs

Question 3:
Q: What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
A: I can't think of any way.
